**If you're more officially proposing a task for Distense, please follow these rules**

*** Task Title Here *** (<= 70 chars or so)

*** Link to task on Distense website *** 

Example: _https://disten.se/tasks/Show-which-network-connected-to-in-footer/1517543032517a7b124c0_

*** Task Spec *** 

_These are some guidelines we believe can make Distense more productive:_

1. Make the task as small as it can be but no smaller
2. Be as specific as possible
3. Keep the task title as short as possible
    - This will minimize the blockchain storage costs and the overall size of the Ethereum blockchain


Once you create a task here, and if you own enough DID, [add the task](https://disten.se/tasks/add) to our website.  
If you don't own enough DID to add the task (the number can be found [here](https://disten.se/tasks/add), ping John like so: @johnallen 
  and he will add the task to our website.  If you have no idea what we're talking about, read about [How Distense Works](https://disten.se/howitworks)
