**If you're more officially proposing a task for Distense, please follow these rules**

** Task Title ** (<= 70 chars or so)

** Link to Distense website task ** 

Once you create a task here, and if you own enough DID, [add the task](https://disten.se/tasks/add) to our website.  
If you don't own enough DID to add the tasks (the number can be found [here](https://disten.se/tasks/add), "at" John like so: @johnallen 
  and he will add the task to our website.  If you have no idea what we're talking about, read about [How Distense Works](https://disten.se/howitworks)


**General Task Guidelines** 

1. Make the task as small as it can be but no smaller
2. Be as specific as possible
3. Keep the task title as short as possible
    - This will minimize the blockchain storage costs and the overall size of the Ethereum blockchain
