                    You may exchange ether only to the extent you have
                    contributed to Distense. I.e, according to the number of DID

                    DID have a very high chance of being worthless. DID are not
                    traded on any exchange and are non-transferable. Lots has to
                    happen for DID to be worth anything.

                  <List.Item>
                    If you are idealistically aligned with Distense, have a
                    super long-term timeframe in mind, then maybe, just maybe,
                    you should consider giving up your precious ether for DID.
