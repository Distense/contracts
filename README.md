# contracts

First contributors contract is deployed to Ropsten at 0x098964520943bbf6731aa02ca9c7b1eb8c34e4f9
We can now add data to that contract and query it from the frontend without frontend contributors needing to compile and migrate contracts (although I guess we will need a testnet node still).
