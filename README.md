## What is Distense?

Distense is a decentralized code cooperative: a company without executives, offices, meetings and bosses.  Every contributor to Distense earns DID, an Ethereum token.  There's no ICO, but code contributors may invest small amounts, initially.  Hodlers of DID govern Distense on a one-vote-per-DID basis.
